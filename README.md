# Rate My Scholar Server

## Background

This is the server that hosts all the data for the Rate My Scholar frontend within a database.


## Setup

NOTE: This assumes you have installed a Node version >= 10 as per the [Create React App docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

Installed libraries may need to be manually reinstalled with:

```
npm install
```


Since we're using Create React App for this, setting it up requires the following command:

```
$ npm start
```

which as per the Create React docs does the following:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Running this server will allow for the Rate My Scholar frontend interface to function properly with respect to data and consequently should be done first.**

## Deployment

Heroku makes it really easy to deploy Create React Apps and we followed the instructions from this [wiki](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).
